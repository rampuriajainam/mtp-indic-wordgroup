# Run log

One row per run. Owner: Jainam (training); Om adds the evaluated numbers from `results/`.
Eval sets: `eval_small` = IndicCorp raw rows 0-99 (~50 sentences), `eval` = rows 0-999 (~500). "h{d}" = head d (predicts token t+d+1); loss = mean CE; % = top-1.

## Laptop (RTX 4060, bf16), before the package

| run | what | result |
|---|---|---|
| NTP baseline | LoRA r=8, 100k raw rows (~50k sentences), legacy script | eval_small h0 **3.05**, flat (lr/rank sweeps did not help) |
| MTP k=2 linear | legacy `MedusaWrapper`, 12,500 batches, heads summed | eval_small h0 **3.09**, h1 8.10 → **5.84** |

## `scripts/train.py` checks (laptop, bf16)

| run | steps | eval set | h0 | h1 | h2 | h3 | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | 100 | eval_small | 3.054 | | | | matches laptop NTP (3.069 @100) |
| R1 | 100 | eval_small | 3.096 | 7.90 | | | matches laptop MTP (3.102 / 8.10 @100); same trainable-param count |
| R0 | 2000 | eval | 2.836 (42.5%) | | | | reference for the α pilot |
| R2 α=0.0 | 2000 | eval | 2.836 (42.5%) | 5.688 (12.5%) | 6.598 (6.4%) | 6.996 (4.1%) | heads detached: LM identical to R0 |
| R2 α=0.1 | 2000 | eval | 2.847 (42.3%) | 5.595 (12.7%) | 6.487 (6.7%) | 6.878 (4.4%) | **chosen** (`head_backbone_grad: 0.1`) |
| R2 α=1.0 | 2000 | eval | 3.034 (40.1%) | 5.422 (13.2%) | 6.263 (7.1%) | 6.634 (4.9%) | heads best, verifier 0.20 worse |

α = `head_backbone_grad`, the share of the extra heads' gradient that reaches LoRA. Zero-init resblock heads start as copies of head 0, so at init h1/h2/h3 = 9.37 / 10.59 / 10.95 (random linear heads: ~10.5).

## Kaggle (T4 x2, fp32 weights + fp16 autocast, ~0.34 s/step)

Step 12500, eval_small (50 sentences, `data.eval_n: 100` raw rows). Cell: loss (top-1). In-group / at-boundary top-1 from `train.py`'s reference eval with `hi_rules_v0`.

| ID | commit | config | Kaggle dataset | h0 | h1 | h2 | h3 | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | fe87853 | R0.yaml | `jainamrampuria/mtp-run-R0` | 3.049 (39.8%) | | | | 2026-10-09; 0.29 s/step; h0 in-group / boundary 57.7 / 31.4% |
| R1 | fe87853 | R1.yaml | `jainamrampuria/mtp-run-R1` | 3.068 (39.3%) | 5.570 (13.9%) | | | 2026-10-09; 0.36 s/step; in-group / boundary h0 56.0 / 31.5%, h1 25.2 / 13.0% |
| R2 | fe87853 | R2.yaml (α=0.1) | `jainamrampuria/mtp-run-R2` | 3.052 (39.6%) | 5.533 (13.8%) | 6.402 (7.8%) | 6.801 (4.4%) | 2026-10-09; 0.38 s/step; in-group / boundary h0 56.5 / 31.7%, h1 24.5 / 13.0%, h2 19.3 / 7.5%, h3 13.3 / 4.4% |

Datasets hold `config.yaml`, `metrics.jsonl`, `train.log`, `step_12000/`, `step_12500/` (private; shared with Om).

**Gate B: passed.** R0 h0 3.049 vs laptop 3.05; R1 h0 3.068 vs 3.09 (both within 0.05). R1 h1 5.57 vs 5.84 is 0.27 *better*, which fits the known differences: the legacy script summed head losses, the laptop trained on raw rows 100+ with half of them blank, and bf16 vs fp16 autocast. Head 0 of the MTP runs stays within 0.02 of R0, so `head_backbone_grad: 0.1` holds the verifier at NTP quality over the full 12.5k steps.

On eval_small the h0 loss is flat from step 250 (3.052) to 12500 (3.049), so the gains are in heads 1-3. The full 500-sentence eval set and FLORES come from Om's `evaluate.py` (OM-4/OM-7).

## Official evaluation (OM-7 `scripts/evaluate.py`, OM-8)

Step 12500, grouper `hi_rules_v0`, Kaggle T4. JSONs in `results/{run}/eval_{dataset}.json` (INTERFACES §10).
Cell: loss (top-1). In-group / boundary = top-1 when the target is / is not in the source token's word group.

**IndicCorp eval (raw rows 0-999, ~500 sentences)**

| run | h0 | h1 | h2 | h3 | in-group / boundary top-1 (h0 · h1 · h2 · h3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| R1 | 2.866 (42.0%) | 5.468 (15.4%) |  |  | 58.2% / 34.2% · 28.7% / 14.3% |

Targets per head (R2): h0 26,563 (in-group 8,729), h1 26,063 (in-group 1,886), h2 25,563 (in-group 557), h3 25,063 (in-group 171).

**FLORES-200 devtest hin_Deva (1,012 sentences)**

| run | h0 | h1 | h2 | h3 | in-group / boundary top-1 (h0 · h1 · h2 · h3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | 3.956 (30.2%) |  |  |  | 44.1% / 21.7% |
| R1 | 3.957 (30.1%) | 6.377 (10.4%) |  |  | 43.9% / 21.7% · 15.0% / 9.8% |
| R2 | 3.946 (30.3%) | 6.358 (10.3%) | 7.070 (5.9%) | 7.341 (4.4%) | 44.1% / 21.9% · 12.5% / 10.0% · 12.1% / 5.7% · 12.1% / 4.3% |

Targets per head (R2): h0 29,135 (in-group 11,025), h1 28,123 (in-group 3,116), h2 27,111 (in-group 1,009), h3 26,099 (in-group 298).

Checks and observations:

- R0 h0 on `eval` = 2.835, matching the laptop R0 at 2k steps (2.836). Head 0 of R2 is within +0.006 of R0 (R1, α = 1: +0.031).
- In-group targets are easier than boundary targets for every head. Ratio of top-1 (R2) on `eval`: 1.7× / 1.6× / 2.4× / 3.4× for h0-h3; on FLORES 2.0× / 1.25× / 2.1× / 2.8×. FLORES h1 has the smallest gap (12.5% vs 10.0%).
- R1's linear head 1 beats R2's resblock head 1 on in-group top-1 (28.7% vs 23.4% on `eval`) at similar overall top-1 (15.4% vs 15.0%). Worth a look before R3 is compared against R2.
- In-group counts for h3 are small (171 on `eval`), so h3 in-group numbers are noisy.
- FLORES is harder for every head (h0 ~3.95 vs ~2.84): a different domain from the IndicCorp training text.
